# Project
# 🛣️ Turkey Highway Toll Checker (Python)

A simple Python script that helps users check whether specific highways or bridges in Turkey are **toll-free or paid** — including special conditions such as **public holidays** (when state-operated roads may become temporarily free).

## 🚀 Features

- Lookup by highway code (e.g., `O-1`, `O-4`, `YSS`, `AVRASYA`)
- Identifies if the road is **paid**, **free**, or **free during public holidays**
- Differentiates between **KGM-operated** and **YİD (Build-Operate-Transfer)** toll systems
- Includes built-in holiday periods (editable)
- Easy to run from terminal

## 📦 Requirements

No additional libraries required. Works with any standard Python 3 installation.

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python highway_checker.py
